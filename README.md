Blog Website


Introduction:
The Blog Website is a dynamic platform where users can share and explore articles and ideas. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to create posts by providing details such as the title, publication date, author, description, and images. The homepage displays these posts in an organized format, with unique styling for posts created by the user, which are presented in a smaller layout for distinction.
