Blog Website


Introduction:
The Blog Website is a dynamic platform where users can share and explore articles and ideas. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it allows users to create posts by providing details such as the title, publication date, author, description, and images. The homepage displays these posts in an organized format, with unique styling for posts created by the user, which are presented in a smaller layout for distinction.

Features:
Homepage: Displays blog posts in an organized and visually appealing format.
Post Highlights: User-created posts are styled smaller for better visual distinction.
Navigation Bar: Provides easy access to different sections of the site.

Comment Section: Enables users to leave comments on blog posts.
